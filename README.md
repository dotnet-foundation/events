# Event Sponsorship Requests

This repo is for submitting a request for an event sponsorship. To get started submit an issue.

There are three types of event sponsorship to choose from:
  * In-kind sponsorship
  * Financial sponsorship 
  * Individual sponsorship

**In-kind Sponsorship**  
Are you hosting a .NET Conf Watch Party? A community event? A developer conference? You may request stickers/t-shirts/swag and promotional assistance. Requests should include date, location, anticipated number of attendees, and event description/focus. Please make your request no later than four weeks prior to the event kickoff.  

**Financial Sponsorship**  
If you are interested in having the .NET Foundation sponsor your upcoming event or meeting, please include date, location, anticipated number of attendees, event description/focus, sponsorship level/cost and benefits of sponsorship. Requests must be made no later than four weeks prior to your event or meeting.  

**Individual Sponsorship**  
If you would like to attend an event as a .NET Foundation representative, please provide full detail of the event, event opportunity, requested amount of sponsorship, and benefit to the .NET Foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
We will accept proposals based on our budget and priorities. We will ask the following questions in your submission and prioritize accordingly. 

-	Does the sponsorships provide an opportunity to evangelize the benefits of the .NET platform to a wider community of developers and/or enable the .NET Foundation to promote the benefits of the open source model to developers already using .NET?
-	Has the requestor and/or event received sponsorship from the Foundation in the past 12 months?
-	How many people will be reached?
-	Is the event/meeting inclusive?
-	Are there co-marketing opportunities?
-	What is given in exchange for the funds/swag?

The .NET Foundation will only sponsor and support events and meetings with a clear and published Code of Conduct. Any event or meetings sponsored by the .NET Foundation (in-kind, financially, or otherwise) should provide an inclusive, harassment-free experience to all of its attendees and participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expressions, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof.

## Reporting Requirements
Anyone who receives sponsorship will be expected to provide a report within 2 weeks of the event ending using this form.
