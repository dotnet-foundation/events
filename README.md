# Event Sponsorship Requests


There are three types of event sponsorship to choose from:
  * In-kind sponsorship
  * Financial sponsorship 
  * Individual sponsorship

**In-kind Sponsorship**

Requests should include date, location, anticipated number of attendees, and event description/focus. Please make your request no later than four weeks prior to the event kickoff.  

**Financial Sponsorship**  
If you are interested in having the .NET Foundation sponsor your upcoming event or meeting, please include date, location, anticipated number of attendees, event description/focus, sponsorship level/cost and benefits of sponsorship. Requests must be made no later than four weeks prior to your event or meeting.  

**Individual Sponsorship**  
If you would like to attend an event as a .NET Foundation representative, please provide full detail of the event, event opportunity, requested amount of sponsorship, and benefit to the .NET Foundation.
